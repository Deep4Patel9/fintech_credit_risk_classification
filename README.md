# fintech_credit_risk_classification

Using logistic regression models to fit loan application data to better predict high-risk and healthy loan applicants.

---

## Technologies

This project uses python 3.7 along with jupyter lab 3.0.14 with the following packages:


* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - For data manipulation and analysis

* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - To split, scale, model, and analyse datasets

* [imblearn](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/) - To analyse and oversample datasets

---

## Installation Guide

Before running the application first install the following dependencies:

```python
$ pip install pandas
$ pip install -U scikit-learn
$ conda install -c conda-forge imbalanced-learn
```

---

## Usage

This project is used to analyse which of the two models used, logistic regression fitted with scaled data or logistic regression fitted with scaled oversampled data, can better predict high-risk loan applicants.
